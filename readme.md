# Cthulhu
![Cthulhu](docs/img/Logo-Blue.png)

Cthulhu is a Chaos Engineering tool that helps evaluating the resiliency of microservice systems.  It does that by simulating various disaster scenarios against a target infrastructure in a data-driven manner.

## Chaos Engineering
An ideal platform should be able to automatically detect failures and heal itself back to a normal state without any interruption of service.  Running disaster scenarios expose gaps in the self-healing ability of a platform.  Knowing about the short comings of the infrastruvcture allows engineering teams to become more efficient at recovering the system in the event of a disaster (either manually or by perfecting the self-healing features of the platform).

## Running from Gradle
The following command will run a given disaster scenario and output the log to the console.  See the module-specific 
instructions (below) on how to configure the container for them.  To specify re-usable configurations for Cthulhu, copy 
`./src/main/resources/application-overrides-template.properties` as `./src/main/resources/application-overrides.properties` 
1. `./gradlew bootRun < <path-to-scenario>`

## Building the Docker Image
1. `./gradlew prepareDocker -Penvironment=docker` — environment=docker excludes the application-overrides.properties from 
the jar file.
2. `docker build -t cthulhu .`

## Running from Docker 
The following command will run a given disaster scenario in a docker container, output the log to the console, and clean-up the container once the 
process has completed.  See the module-specific instructions (below) on how to configure the container for them.
```bash
   docker run -it --rm \
   -v <path-to-scenario>:/etc/cthulhu/scenario.yaml \
   cthulhu
```

#### Environment variable mapping
Environment variables can be used to define/overwrite configuration values using the following pattern 
`ABC_DEF --> abc.def`.

## Disaster Scenarios
Cthulhu executes Scenario files that contain a list of Chaos Events.  The Scenario files are in YAML format.  The 
following show the usage of all shared fields.  Refer to module-specific instructions for Chaos Events.

**Scenario**
* `name` — Name of the Scenario (used for logging).
* `chaosevents` — One or more Chaos Event entry:

**Chaos Event**
* `description` — Describes what this Chaos Event does (used for logging).
* `engine` — The target infrastructure engine (see module-specific instructions).
* `operation` — Operation to run (see module-specific instructions).
* `quantity` — Subset of the matched instances to affect.  The subset is taken randomly from the `targets`.  If missing, all matches are affected.
* `schedule` — Define delays and repetitions for the event (See the Schedule section).  If missing, the event will be executed once immediately.
* `skip` — Number of `targets` that will not be affected.  This can be used in conjunction with `schedule` to ensure a service is kept below its normal availability level, while ensuring it is not completely disabled.
* `target` — Expressions used by the Chaos Engine to identify instances to target.

**Schedule**
* `delay` — Delay before executing each occurrence of an event (e.g. 30s).
* `delayjitter` — Random amount of time added or removed from the delay (e.g. delay: 30s + delayjitter: 5s = 30s±5s).
* `initialdelay` — Delay before executing the first occurrence of an event (e.g. 10m).  If missing, delay is used.
* `repeat` — Number of repetition of this event.  If missing, the event will execute once.

## Global Configuration
* `cthulhu.event.timeout.default` — Default delay before cancelling Chaos Events.
  
## Google Cloud Configuration
* `gcp.account.json` — Path to a Google Cloud credential file.
  * [How to create a Google Cloud Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).
  * To interact with VM instances, your service account must have the `Compute Admin` role.
* `gcp.project` — The name of the Google Cloud project which to connect.
  
#### Docker Configurations for GCP
* Passing-in a Google Cloud credential file: `-v ~/.ssh/sa_dev_chaostest.json:/etc/secrets/gcp-account.json`
* Specifying a GCP project: `-e GCP_PROJECT=<project-id>`

#### GCP Chaos Events
* `engine` — Set to `gcp-compute`.
* `target` — Follows this pattern: `<zone>/<vm-name>`.  Both Zone and VM Name supports regular expressions.

**Delete VMs**
* `operation` — Set to `delete`.

**Reset VMs**
* `operation` — Set to `reset`.

**Stop Vms**
* `operation` — Set to `stop`.
   
## Kubernetes Configuration
* `kube.config` — Path to a Kubernetes config.  This is generally `~/.kube/config` for the current user.  
  * [How get a K8s context for the Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart).
  * To interact with containers, your service account must have the `Kubernetes Engine Admin` role.
    
#### Docker Configurations for K8s
* Passing-in a Kube config file: `-v ~/.kube/config:/etc/secrets/kube.config`

#### K8s Chaos Events
* `engine` — Set to `kubernetes`.
* `target` — Follows this pattern: `<namespace>/<pod-name>`.  Both Namespace and Pod Name supports regular expressions.

**Delete Pods**
* `operation` — Set to `delete`.

## Slack Notifications
* `slack.audit.filter` — List of audit types to include in the Slack notifications (see the auditing section).
* `slack.audit.<audit-type>.message` — Customize notifications per audit type.  The placeholder `%s` can be used to 
indicate where to put the original notification message.
* `slack.channels` — Override the default webhook channel.  Supports multiple values, using the syntax 
`#channelA #channelB`.
* `slack.icon_emoji` — Override the webhook avatar using an emoji (eg. `:smiling_imp:`).
* `slack.username` — Override the webhook's display name.
* `slack.webhook.url` — URL of a [Slack incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).
  
#### Docker Configurations for Slack Notifications
* Specifying a webhook URL: `-e SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`

## Building Additional Chaos Engines
Each Chaos Engine has its own sub-project, which has a dependency on the api project.  The main class must extends from
`com.xmatters.testing.cthulhu.api.eventrunner.ChaosEngine` and be marked with the annotation 
`com.xmatters.testing.cthulhu.api.annotations.EngineName`. The value of `EngineName` will match the `engine` field in 
Chaos Events.

Once a new Chaos Engine is created, a reference must be added in the main `build.gradle` file. 

Operation methods are public methods declared in the ChaosEngine, and marked with the annotation 
`com.xmatters.testing.cthulhu.api.annotations.OperationName`.  The value of `OperationName` will match the `operation` 
field in Chaos Events.  Operation methods must take an array parameter of the same type that is returned by the 
`getTargets` method.

The `T[] getTargets(ChaosEvent ev)` method must return an array of a concrete type.  All possible matches of a target 
must be returned.  `skip` and `quantity` are applied by the ChaosEventHandler before the final selection is then given 
to an operation method as parameter. 

## Building Additional Chaos Auditors
Each Chaos Auditor has its own sub-project, which has a dependency on the api project.  The main class must implements 
`com.xmatters.testing.cthulhu.api.auditing.ChaosAuditor`.  Additionally the same class can extend from 
`com.xmatters.testing.cthulhu.api.configuration.ModuleConfiguration` if it needs to configure itself.

Once a new Chaos Auditor is created, a reference must be added in the main `build.gradle` file.
